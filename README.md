# Baseline

Monochrome dark theme for VSCode. Designed for focus and clarity.
With fine-tuned grayscale palette that's easy on eyes.

## Variants

Baseline theme provides a balanced contrast, but for those seeking a darker or softer look, there are two variants:

- **baseline.soft** — lighter background with softer contrast.
- **baseline.zero** — darker background with mint accent for deep vibe-coding sessions.
